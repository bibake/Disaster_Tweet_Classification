# Disaster_Tweet_Classification

The [notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u_UejkPSl6pCs_5SP_uS-lIlzPcWlUVt/view?usp=sharing) in this repository depicts a comprehensive programming solution to solve the Kaggle text classification challenge described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview).

<br>

The task is a supervised binary text classification task of tweets from Twitter. The tweets are classified as either related to a **real disaster** or **not**. The purpose of the task is to establish an algorithm that can automatically and accurately determine if a tweet is referring to a real disaster or not. The applications for this are wide-ranging. Among the main uses is as an **emergency response support tool**. 

<br>

At a high level, this notebook achieves the following:

- Understand data
- Prepare data
- Train classification algorithms
- Make predictions on unseen data

<br>

The notebook is organized in the following sections:

1. Introduction
2. Load and Explore Data
3. Baseline Models
4. Further Cleaning and Modelling
5. Deep Learning
6. Conclusion

The main focus of this notebook is on non-deep learning techniques. Thus, only the last portion of the notebook is dedicated to deep learning.
